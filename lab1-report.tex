\section{Introduction}
This assignment was about exploring the characteristics of transmission lines (abbrv. T.L.), studying voltage and current 
propagation along the T.L.s, as well as depedance on loads.

Introduction to the lab and its purpose. The following is the reflection coefficient for a transmission line

\[
    \label{simple_equation}
    \Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}
\]

\section{Determining the Characteristic Impedance, $Z_0$}

// TODO: Ask prof about 3.2 question 1. Wording unclear

We changed the variable load on the switch box, until we saw no reflection.
This was at $Z_L = 50 \Omega$ which is also equal to the charactertic impedance 
since we know that the reflections nullify when $Z_L = Z_0$. The corresponding waveform
measured at the generator input (channel 1) and the transmission line input (channel 2) is also shown in Figure 1.

\section{Determining $Z_0$ using $\frac{v_1(t,0)}{i_1(t,0)}$}

As seen in the picture the voltage at $v_g$ is 154mV and $v_1$ is equal to 51mV. Assuming the resistance in between is $100\Omega$ 
 $i_l$ = $\frac{0.154-0.051}{100}$ = $1.03*10^-3$A. Which means $Z_0=\frac{v_1}{i_l}=\frac{0.051}{1.03*10^-3}=49.51\Omega~50\Omega $


\section{Observation of Travelling Waves}

We know that the phase velocity of an electromagentic wave in space with magnetic permeability, $\mu$,
and electric permittivitty, $\epsilon$  is given by:
$$v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}$$
