\section{Introduction}
This assignment was about exploring the characteristics of transmission lines (abbrv. T.L.), studying voltage and current 
propagation along the T.L.s, as well as depedance on loads.

Introduction to the lab and its purpose. The following is the reflection coefficient for a transmission line

\[
    \label{reflection_coefficient}
    \Gamma = \frac{Z_L - Z_0}{Z_L + Z_0}
\]

\section{Determining the Characteristic Impedance, $Z_0$}

We varied the load on the switch box until we saw little or no traces of reflected waves.
This was at $Z_L = 50 \Omega$ which is also equal to the charactertic impedance 
since we know that the reflections nullify when $Z_L = Z_0$. The corresponding waveforms
captured at the generator input (channel 1, yellow) and the transmission line input (channel 2, green) 
are shown in Figure 1.

\section{Determining $Z_0$ using $\frac{\tilde V^+(z=0)}{\tilde I^+(z=0)}$}

As seen in the picture the voltage at $v_g$ is 154mV and $v_1$ is equal to 51mV. Assuming the resistance in between is $100\Omega$ 
 $i_l$ = $\frac{0.154-0.051}{100}$ = $1.03*10^-3$A. Which means $Z_0=\frac{v_1}{i_l}=\frac{0.051}{1.03*10^-3}=49.51\Omega~50\Omega $


\section{Observation of Travelling Waves}

We know that the phase velocity of an electromagentic wave in space with magnetic permeability, $\mu$,
and electric permittivitty, $\epsilon$  is given by:
$$v_p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}}$$
